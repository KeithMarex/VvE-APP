In NativeScript, the app.scss file is where you place SCSS rules that
you would like to apply to your entire application. Check out
http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/styling for a full list of the SCSS
selectors and properties you can use to style UI components.

/*
In many cases you may want to use the NativeScript core theme instead
of writing your own SCSS rules. You can learn more about the
NativeScript core theme at https://github.com/nativescript/theme
The imported SCSS rules must precede all other types of rules.
